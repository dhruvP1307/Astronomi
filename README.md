# AstronomiðŸŒŸðŸŒƒ
**What the Project Does**
This project performs automatic classification of astronomical images using deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It identifies and categorizes celestial objects such as spiral galaxies, elliptical galaxies, and star clusters from telescope image datasets. The model is trained to recognize patterns and features in astronomical imagery, making it a powerful tool for assisting astronomers in organizing and interpreting large volumes of observational data.

**Why the Project Is Useful**
Astronomical surveys generate vast amounts of image data, making manual classification time-consuming and error-prone. This project automates the process, significantly improving the speed and accuracy of image analysis. It aids scientific research by helping astronomers detect and classify celestial bodies efficiently, thus accelerating discoveries in space science and astrophysics. It also provides a practical example of how machine learning can be applied in real-world scientific domains.
